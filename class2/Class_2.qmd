## Before you start...

Make sure you have the following set and ready:

- Folder you want touse as your working directory exists on your HDD
- Set this folder as working directory (using a menu or `setwd("YOUR_PATH)`)
- Relevant data (if provided) is in your working directory
:::

**In the below instructions...**

**EXERCISE 1:** are bits of code to execute/practice pieces to do, often with only hints on how to perform them.

**Output** indicates the typical output you should expect from a given instruction.



## Paths in R

Paths in R can be relative or absolute. For example, in my environment my current working directory is 

```{r}
#| echo: !expr format %in% c("html")


getwd()
```

Which is very long and hard to rememeber/type in. However, once set I can refer to files in this folder using *relative* paths (skipping the part leading TO the root directory). E.g. for the `class2` folder I can just write `"class2"` or `"./class2"`.
