**Output** indicates the typical output you should expect from a given instruction.

## Data

We will work on a simple dataset on cholesterol levels from patients. The data presents cholesterol concentrations in plasma in patients before diet, and after 4 & 8 weeks of diet containing one of two types of margarine. The age group of patients is also indicated. Data can be downloaded here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wbabik/Practical_computing/teaching/Class_10/data/Cholesterol_Age_R.csv

```{r echo = T}
data_chol <- read.table('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wbabik/Practical_computing/teaching/Class_10/data/Cholesterol_Age_R.csv',
                       sep = ';', header = T,
                       stringsAsFactors = T)

head(data_chol)
summary(data_chol)
```
